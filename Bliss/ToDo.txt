FOR NEXT RELEASE
- do more robust lost device handling when device is lost due to window focus in fullscreen mode
  emulator should pause instead of constantly trying to re-obtain the device, forcing the user back
  into the Bliss window
- when the emulator is paused and the user switches between windowed and full-screen, the emulator
  output does not redraw correctly, probably due to graphics on the texture that need to be
  reloaded
- correctly select the first item in the tree when the options window is displayed
- make the options window resizable
- bind a control combination (&&) or more than one control (||) to an input; some of this is
  there, but still need to resolve how to save such complex input configurations in the registry

LONG TERM VISION
- video
    - display the window menu in fullscreen mode
    - offer the ability to display the overlays somehow, maybe as a toggle display for the
      lower left and right sides of the screen
- input
    - enable user to configure the ENTER or SPACE keyboard keys
    - allow the user to custom-bind different controls to different games
- saving and loading
    - saving and loading game state
    - saving screenshots
    - record/playback (save the inputs and play them back)
    - record audio
    - record video
- other stuff
    - allow user to start ECS without a cartridge
    - ROMBanker is being saved as a RAM block in Rip::SaveRip(); need a more comprehensive ROM
      banking solution
