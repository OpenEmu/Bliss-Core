FOR NEXT RELEASE
- video
    - fix the video niggles along the seam between the triangles
    - the "/fullscreen" command line option is not working for the version downloaded in the .zip
      file; we should probably also check to see if a cart passed on the command line is broken
      in the .zip version as well.
    - missiles in Astrosmash go straight through meteors, but they should be destroyed

LONG TERM VISION
- video
    - offer the ability to display the overlays somehow, maybe as a toggle display for the
      lower left and right sides of the screen
    - display the window menu in fullscreen mode
- input
    - bind a control combination (&&) or more than one control (||) to an input
    - allow user to unbind an input configuration
    - enable user to configure the ENTER or SPACE keyboard keys
    - allow the user to custom-bind different controls to different games
- saving and loading
    - saving and loading game state
    - saving screenshots
    - record/playback (save the inputs and play them back)
    - record audio
    - record video
- other stuff
    - change .bin/.int support so that it is not file-extension specific, but instead is the
      last fallback method of loading the selected file (?)
    - allow user to start ECS without a cartridge
    - support ability to pause; this will enable more robust lost device handling
    - ROMBanker is being saved as a RAM block in Rip::SaveRip(); need a more comprehensive ROM
      banking solution
