FOR NEXT RELEASE
- support atari 5200 images within .zip files
- bug where I can't add bindings to the ECS keyboard default bindings; have to clear the
  binding first because it's getting confused somehow

LONG TERM VISION
- video
    - still a video glitch along the triangle seam; see Thin Ice dead center of the title
      screen for the glitch
    - display the window menu in fullscreen mode
    - offer the ability to display the overlays somehow, maybe as a toggle display for the
      lower left and right sides of the screen
- input
    - allow the user to custom-bind different controls to different games
- saving and loading
    - saving and loading game state
    - saving screenshots
    - record/playback (save the inputs and play them back)
    - record audio
    - record video
- other stuff
    - allow user to start ECS without a cartridge
    - ROMBanker is being saved as a RAM block in Rip::SaveRip(); need a more comprehensive ROM
      banking solution
